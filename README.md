The Digital Earth South Africa (DESA) Notebooks repository (`deafrica-sandbox-notebooks`) hosts Jupyter Notebooks, 
Python scripts and workflows for analysing [DESA] satellite data and derived products. This documentation is designed 
to provide a guide to getting started with DESA, and to showcase the wide range of geospatial analyses that can be 
achieved using DESA data and open-source software including [Open Data Cube] and [xarray].
