The Digital Earth South Africa (DESA) Notebooks repository (`deafrica-sandbox-notebooks`) hosts Jupyter Notebooks, 
Python scripts and workflows for analysing [DESA] satellite data and derived products. This documentation is designed 
to provide a guide to getting started with DESA, and to showcase the wide range of geospatial analyses that can be 
achieved using DESA data and open-source software including [Open Data Cube] and [xarray].

The repository is based around the following directory structure (from simple to increasingly complex applications):

1. [Beginners_guide] - *Introductory notebooks aimed at introducing Jupyter Notebooks and how to load, plot and 
   interact with DESA data*

2. [Datasets] - *Notebooks introducing DE Africa's satellite datasets and derived products, including how to load each 
   dataset and any special features of the data. Some external datasets that are useful for analysing and interpreting 
   DESA products are also covered.*

3. [Frequently_used_code] - *A recipe book of simple code examples demonstrating how to perform common geospatial 
   analysis tasks using DESA and open-source software*

4. [Real_world_examples] - *More complex workflows demonstrating how DE Africa can be used to address 
   real-world problems*

The supporting scripts and data for the notebooks are kept in the following directories:

- [Scripts] - *Python functions and algorithms developed to assist in analysing DE Africa data (e.g. loading data, 
  plotting, spatial analysis, machine learning)* 

- [Supplementary_data] - *Supplementary files required for the analyses above (e.g. images, rasters, shapefiles, 
  training data)*
