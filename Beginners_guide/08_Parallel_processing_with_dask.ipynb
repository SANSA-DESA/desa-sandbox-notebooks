    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dask](https://dask.org/) is a useful tool when working with large analyses (either in space or time) as it breaks\n",
    "data into manageable chunks that can be easily stored in memory. It can also use multiple computing cores to speed up\n",
    "computations. This has numerous benefits for analyses, which will be covered in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers how to enable Dask as part of loading data, which can allow you to analyse larger areas and\n",
