    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dask](https://dask.org/) is a useful tool when working with large analyses (either in space or time) as it breaks\n",
    "data into manageable chunks that can be easily stored in memory. It can also use multiple computing cores to speed up\n",
    "computations. This has numerous benefits for analyses, which will be covered in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers how to enable Dask as part of loading data, which can allow you to analyse larger areas and\n",
    "longer time-spans without crashing the DESA Environment, as well as potentially speeding up your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The difference between the standard load command and loading with Dask.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition tells Dask to cut the data into chunks containing 10000 pixels in the `x` and `y` dimensions and one\n",
    "measurement in the `time` dimension. For DESA, we always set `'time': 1` in the `dask_chunk` definition, since the\n",
    "data files only span a single time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a chunk size is not provided for a given dimension, or if it set to -1, then the chunk will be set to the size\n",
    "of the array in that dimension. This means all the data in that dimension will be loaded at once, rather than being\n",
    "broken into smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing Dask chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a visual intuition for how the data has been broken into chunks, we can use the `.data` attribute provided\n",
    "by `xarray`. This attribute can be used on individual measurements from the lazy-loaded data. When used in a Jupyter\n",
