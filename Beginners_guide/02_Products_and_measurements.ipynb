    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"datacube\" is a digital information architecture that specialises in hosting and cataloguing spatial information.\n",
    "[Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa)] is based on the [Open Data Cube] infrastructure, and specialises in storing\n",
    "remotely sensed data, particularly from Earth Observation satellites such as [Landsat] and [Sentinel].\n",
    "\n",
    "The DESA datacube contains both raw satellite data and derivative data \"products\".\n",
    "These data products are often composed of a range of \"measurements\" such as the suite of remote sensing band values or\n",
    "statistical product summaries. Before running a query to load data from the datacube, it is useful to know what it\n",
    "contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates several straightforward ways to inspect the product and measurement contents of a datacube.\n",

    "\n",
    "- How to connect to a datacube\n",
