    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualisation is an important component of working with Earth Observation data.\n",
    "The `xarray` Python package provides a range of straightforward data plotting options which allow users to quickly\n",
    "generate simple plots from multi-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "To generate more complex and informative plots from data loaded from DESA, the Notebooks repository also provides a\n",
    "custom plotting module with additional easy-to-use functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This introductory notebook demonstrates how to visualise DESA satellite data returned from running a\n",
    "datacube query.\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates commonly used `xarray` plotting methods, as well as custom functions provided in\n",
    "the [deafrica_plotting](../Scripts/deafrica_plotting.py) script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- View your area of interest prior to querying the datacube\n",
    "- Querying the datacube and loading data\n",
    "- Plotting single band data (e.g. a single satellite band)\n",
    "  - Selecting and plotting individual timesteps\n",
    "  - Plotting multiple timesteps\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load packages\n",
    "\n",
    "First we run `%matplotlib inline`, which ensures figures plot correctly in the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to load the `datacube` package, which allows us to load some data and a selection of custom DE Africa\n",
    "functions from the `deafrica_plotting` script. The `deafrica_plotting` script is located inside\n",
    "the [deafrica-sandbox-notebooks repository](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks), inside\n",
    "the Scripts folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the custom functions on the sandbox, a copy of the python file containing the custom function needs to\n",
    "be saved in the folders on the sandbox. We then need to add that folder location to the Python path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we achieve this using `sys.path.append()` to add the `Scripts` folder containing the `deafrica_plotting` python\n",
    "file to the python path. The two custom functions `display_map()` and `rgb()` are then imported form\n",
    "the `deafrica_plotting` python file."
