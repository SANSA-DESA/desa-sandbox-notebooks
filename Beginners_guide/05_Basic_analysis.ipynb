    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the world around us, it's important to combine the key steps of loading, visualising, analysing, and\n",
    "interpreting satellite data. To perform an analysis, we begin with a question and use these steps to reach an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to conduct a basic analysis with DESA data and the Open Data Cube.\n",
    "It will combine many of the steps that have been covered in the other beginner's notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the analysis question is _\"How is the health of vegetation changing over time in a given area?\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be related to a number of broader questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the effect of a new land use practice on a field of crops?\n",
    "- How has a patch of forest changed after a fire?\n",
    "- How does proximity to water affect vegetation throughout the year?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, the analysis question will be kept simple, without much real-world context. \n",
    "For more examples of notebooks that demonstrate how to use DE Africa to answer specific analysis questions, see the\n",
    "notebooks in the \"Real world examples\" folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choosing a study area.\n",
    "2. Loading data for the study area.\n",
    "3. Plotting the chosen data and exploring how it changes with time.\n",
    "4. Calculating a measure of vegetation health from the loaded data.\n",
    "5. Exporting the data for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",

    "The following commands import various functionality: \n",

    "- `sys` provides access to helpful support functions in the `deafrica_plotting` module.\n",
    "- `datacube` provides the ability to query and load data.\n",
    "- `matplotlib` provides the ability to format and manipulate plots."
